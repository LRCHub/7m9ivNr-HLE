[00:13.22] I'm sitting here in the boring room
[00:17.32] It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
[00:20.43] I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do
[00:23.78] I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you
[00:26.73] But nothing ever happens, and I wonder
[00:45.73] 
[00:33.70] I'm driving around in my car
[00:37.02] I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far
[00:40.43] I'd like to change my point of view
[00:43.78] I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you
[00:46.87] But nothing ever happens, and I wonder
[01:05.87] 
[00:53.55] I wonder how
[00:55.49] I wonder why
[00:57.13] Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
[01:00.27] And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
[01:07.06] I'm turning my head up and down
[01:10.65] I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
[01:13.93] And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
[01:38.43] 
[01:20.05] Sing!
[01:21.05] Dap-dadada-dadpm-didap-da
[01:30.60] Dadada-dadpm-didap-da
[01:32.86] Dap-didili-da
[01:39.36] 
[01:35.47] I'm sitting here, I miss the power
[01:38.11] I'd like to go out, taking a shower
[01:41.88] But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
[01:44.15] I feel so tired, put myself into bed
[01:47.21] Well, nothing ever happens, and I wonder
[02:07.21] 
[01:54.33] Isolation is not good for me
[02:01.61] Isolation, well, I don't want to sit on the lemon tree
[02:28.61] 
[02:07.77] I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
[02:11.20] Baby, anyhow I'll get another toy
[02:14.19] And everything will happen, and you wonder
[02:35.19] 
[02:20.99] I wonder how
[02:22.62] I wonder why
[02:24.23] Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
[02:27.68] And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
[02:34.15] I'm turning my head up and down
[02:38.04] I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
[02:40.91] And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
[03:05.41] 
[02:46.69] And I wonder, wonder
[02:48.02] I wonder how
[02:50.18] I wonder why
[02:50.95] Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
[02:54.72] And all that I can see
[03:05.72] 
[02:57.61] And all that I can see (ah, dip, dip, dip)
[03:02.02] And all that I can see
[03:04.19] Is just a yellow lemon tree
